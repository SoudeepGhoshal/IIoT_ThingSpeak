# IIoT_ThingSpeak
Semester 4_IIoT (VT_Lab)

Exp 1: To blink the external LED using ESP32 microcontroller. | Sensor: N/A

Exp 2: Through an ultrasonic sensor using an ESP32 microcontroller (a) to measure the object or obstacle distance, (b) to make an LED blink using the output from the ultrasonic sensor, and (c) to control the brightness of the LED using the distance given by the ultrasonic sensor. | Sensor: HC-SR04

Exp 3: To measure temperature and humidity through the DHT11 sensor using an ESP32 microcontroller. | Sensor: DHT11

Exp 4: Create a ThingSpeak channel, configure the ESP32 microcontroller to send temperature and humidity data through DHT11 sensor to ThingSpeak, and visualize data on the ThingSpeak platform. | Sensor: DHT11

Exp 5: Create a Blynk account, set up a basic Blynk project, and interface with the ESP32 for real-time monitoring. | Sensor: DHT11

Exp 6: Configure the ESP32 to send temperature data to a Blynk app, enabling real-time visualization and control. | Sensor: DHT11
